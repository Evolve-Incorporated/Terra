# Terra

Terra is a natural selection simulator. It simulates an ecosystem with limited resources in which all creates are
omnivores. In order to pass their genes to their offsprings they must find the optimal set of speed, strength and
eyesight.

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, not the most intelligent that survives.
> It is the one that is most adaptable to change.
